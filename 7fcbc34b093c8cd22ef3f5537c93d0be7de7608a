However, if we want to keep the CI build we will have to adapt the pipeline to make java available in the docker images for the build. \n\nI quickly tried with this change [1], but then realised java 8 is not available anymore.\n\nMaybe we could just install it in the \"jenkins/gerrit-sbt-build-app.sh\" since it is not required by other applications/plugins.\n\n[1]: https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/gerrit-ci-scripts/+/435078",
